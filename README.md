# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model predicts the future price of Google (GOOG) stock based on historical data. The code utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building the LSTM model and scikit-learn for data preprocessing. Visualizations include training and validation loss graphs as well as historical data and prediction graphs.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `scikit-learn`
- `yfinance`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn yfinance
```

## Results

-**Training and Validation Loss Graph**: Shows the loss over epochs for both training and validation sets.
-**Historical Data and Prediction Graph**: Displays actual and predicted stock prices over time.
